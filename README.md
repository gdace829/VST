> **Video Streaming Thinking** introduces a new paradigm for streaming video understanding that interleaves active reasoning with continuous video consumption, enabling amortized test-time scaling with real-time responsiveness.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Existing online VideoLLMs focus on efficient streaming perception but lack explicit analytical reasoning. Offline VideoLLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can reason deeply, but incur high query-answer (QA) latency that violates real-time constraints. **VST bridges this gap** by shifting the LLM backend from passive waiting to active, intermittent reasoning *during* video consumption, implementing a **thinking-while-watching** mechanism inspired by human neural coupling.

### ✨ Key Idea

Instead of deferring all reasoning until a user query arrives, VST continuously processes incoming video clips and produces **intermediate streaming thoughts** in real time. This front-loads and amortizes the reasoning cost, so the final response is both **deeply grounded** and **instantly available**.
